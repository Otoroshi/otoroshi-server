Otoroshi Server
===============

Setting up a dev environment
----------------------------

After cloning the repository make sure to install a virtual env as follow :

```
virtualenv .
```

To start using the environment use ``source bin/activate`` (and ``deactivate`` to quit it). To install the required dependencies you need to run pip install :

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now run **Otoroshi Server** by using the ``otoroshi`` script (``./otoroshi``).
